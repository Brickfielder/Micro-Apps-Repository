Word Scavenger: Validity and Design

❇️ Purpose and scope
Word Scavenger is a browser-based rehabilitation exercise developed for individuals with left visuo-spatial neglect after brain injury. 
It requires participants to identify matching word pairs across two columns, always starting from the left, thereby reinforcing systematic 
leftward visual exploration. While primarily designed for neglect, the task also supports lexical retrieval, sustained attention, and working memory.

❇️ Content validity
The design reflects key neuropsychological principles of neglect rehabilitation. The requirement to engage a left-sided anchor before making 
a choice promotes compensatory scanning strategies, consistent with cueing methods used in therapy. Matching tasks further involve semantic 
association, attention to detail, and monitoring of completed items, linking the exercise to broader cognitive domains beyond visuospatial exploration.

❇️ Face validity
The task appears straightforward and relevant to both patients and clinicians. Matching words is a familiar and meaningful activity, while 
the left-starting rule makes its therapeutic intention transparent. Its simplicity supports immediate understanding and acceptance as a 
valid cognitive exercise.

❇️ Ecological validity
Although structured, the task simulates real-world challenges where neglect can affect reading, searching, or identifying objects on the left. 
The requirement to scan and compare across space reflects demands found in everyday tasks such as navigating a page of text, locating items, 
or following written instructions.

❇️ Usability and accessibility
Word Scavenger runs in any standard browser with minimal setup. Visual anchors and progress highlighting help users keep track of their responses, 
while adjustable word sets allow tailoring to patient needs. Clinicians can download logs to monitor performance, making it suitable for 
integration into therapy sessions.

❇️ Safety and burden
The app involves no physical risk. Tasks are brief, repeatable, and adjustable in difficulty to match cognitive tolerance. This helps maintain 
motivation, minimises frustration, and reduces fatigue, especially for individuals with attentional or language deficits.
